# Mapping-pixels
In this code, 1920x1080 pixels are being mapped to 5x4 pixels.
This code uses the library pyautogui to get the current mouse position and the time library for the delays between printing the array.
This code calculates the distance between the current cursor position and some predefined points and uses a linear search algorithm to find the least distance and maps to that point. This code was initially written for controlling a 2d led array.
